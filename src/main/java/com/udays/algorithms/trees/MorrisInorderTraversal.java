/**
 *  ** Morris Inorder Traversal **
 *
 * In this method, we have to use a new data structure-Threaded Binary Tree, and the strategy is as follows:
 *
 * Step 1: Initialize current as root
 *
 * Step 2: While current is not NULL,
 *
 * If current does not have left child
 *
 *     a. Add currentâ€™s value
 *
 *     b. Go to the right, i.e., current = current.right
 *
 * Else
 *
 *     a. In current's left subtree, make current the right child of the rightmost node
 *
 *     b. Go to this left child, i.e., current = current.left
 * For example:
 *
 *
 *           1
 *         /   \
 *        2     3
 *       / \   /
 *      4   5 6
 *
 * First, 1 is the root, so initialize 1 as current, 1 has left child which is 2, the current's left subtree is
 *
 *          2
 *         / \
 *        4   5
 * So in this subtree, the rightmost node is 5, then make the current(1) as the right child of 5. Set current = cuurent.left (current = 2). The tree now looks like:
 *
 *          2
 *         / \
 *        4   5
 *             \
 *              1
 *               \
 *                3
 *               /
 *              6
 * For current 2, which has left child 4, we can continue with thesame process as we did above
 *
 *         4
 *          \
 *           2
 *            \
 *             5
 *              \
 *               1
 *                \
 *                 3
 *                /
 *               6
 * then add 4 because it has no left child, then add 2, 5, 1, 3 one by one, for node 3 which has left child 6, do the same as above. Finally, the inorder taversal is [4,2,5,1,6,3].
