/**
 *  ** Morris Postorder Traversal **
 *
 * In this method, we have to use a new data structure-Threaded Binary Tree, and the strategy is as follows:
 *
 * Step 1: Initialize current as root
 *
 * Step 2: While current is not NULL,
 *
 * If current does not have right child
 *
 *     a. Add currentâ€™s value to deque's front
 *     b. Go to the left, i.e., current = current.left
 *
 * Else
 *
 *     a. In current's right subtree, make current.left the left child of the leftmost node
 *     b. Add current's value
 *     c. Go to this right child, i.e., current = current.right
 * For example:
 *
 *
 *           1
 *         /   \
 *        2     3
 *       / \   /
 *      4   5 6
 *
 * First, 1 is the root, so initialize 1 as current, 1 has right child which is 3, the current's right subtree is
 *
 *          3
 *         /
 *        6
 * So in this subtree, the leftmost node is 6, then make the current.left(2) as the left child of 6. Set current = current.right (current = 3). The tree now looks like:
 *
 *          3
 *         /
 *        6
 *       /
 *      2
 *     / \
 *    4   5
 * For current 3, which there is no right child, so just read the value and add to deque at front. Keep doing this until we have current.right!=null
 *
 *            2
 *          /  \
 *         4    5
 * then follow the same step at above when we have current.right!=null. Finally, the postorder taversal is [4,5,2,6,3,1].
 *
 * For more details, please check Threaded binary tree and Explaination of Morris Method
